# Angular Beginners Workshop

Angular is a Open Source Framework developed by Google. It is one of the most popular JavaScript Frameworks. Its best use for complex components or whole applications and very well documented. You can convince yourself and read [the official documentation of Angular](https://angular.io/docs) and start with [the Hero tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial).

In this workshop we are building a movie app step by step. It is a pratical entry into programmering Angular with TypeScript. Basic know how in JavaScript, HTML and CSS will help you to understand TypeScript, Templating and SCSS.

## Developing Environment

We are using [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/angular) for online coding our example movie app. There will be a box for every step, so you can dive in any time after loosing your code with the example one. This is a good way for practising coding.

Of course you can code local on your machine using your favorite IDE and [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io).
